# rupertodiza

This repository hosts a simple static portfolio website for Rupert. A modern single-page redesign has been added on the `redesign` branch; it uses a Tailwind CDN-based layout and is deployable on GitHub Pages as-is.

To edit the site:
- Update `index.html` with your content (or replace with a static site generator scaffold if you prefer).
- Images live in the `images/` directory.

Deployment:
- The site can be hosted on GitHub Pages from the `main` branch or a docs folder; to publish the redesign, merge the `redesign` branch into `main` and GitHub Pages will serve the updated site.
